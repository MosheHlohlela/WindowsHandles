This project demonstrates how to handle multiple browser windows (parent and child windows) using Selenium WebDriver with Java.
The test navigates to a demo website, opens a new browser window, switches between windows, and retrieves text from each page.
The test performs the following steps:
Launches the Chrome browser
Navigates to the demo website
Clicks on Multiple Windows
Opens a new window
Captures all window handles
Switches to the child window and prints its heading text
Switches back to the parent window and prints its heading text
